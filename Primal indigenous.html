	<h1> Primal indigenous </h1>
	
<h2> 
Primal indigenous religion, although not a single, organized religion, accounts for the belief systems of 300 million people in Africa and Asia. Followers of primal indigenous religions are henotheistic, that is, they worship one god while acknowledging the existence of others. God dwells within all things and all things are spiritual in nature. All of existence is thought to be connected, including life and death, humans and animals, the physical world and spirit world, etc.  </h2>
